NOTES

	1. Added ALL possible contradictions. This gave the following:
	
		1 counter examples found (only showing first)
		Clause:
			((Ob6)^((Ob1)^((Fa1)^(Fa4))))
		Trace:
			1. the flight leave in two hours
			2. the ground crew open the check-in desk 2 hours before
			3. the ground crew request the passenger manifest from the airline
			4. the airline crew provide the passenger manifest to the ground crew
			5. the ground crew close the check-in desk 20 mins before flight leaves
	
	Note O(b6)^O(b1), but b6 # b1. Thus we removed all contradictions involving paying fines, which doesnt make sense anyway
	
	2. Closing the gate was placed under an "if 20 mins earlier" to avoid the problem of having closing the gate at
	the same time as initiating the check-in
