NOTES
    1. Moved everything underneath "if gate open" because open and close gate were at same level
    2. we have no sequence of obligations.. eg when talking about request/response of manifest 5-6
    3. Line 8: This written as a sequence of obligations in the CNL (syntactic constraint of CNL),
        but in CL this is treated as an obligation of a sequence
        Thus note that the CTD applies to the whole thing, i.e. O(a.b.c)_O(pay)
    4. Added more contradictions, to reflect temporal/causal relationships between the actions
    5. Reworded this:
        - {the ground crew} must not issue {any boarding cards without inspecting that the details are correct beforehand}, otherwise
      {the ground crew} must pay {a fine}
    6. Added all possible contradictions, except:
        {the ground crew} close {the check-in desk 20 mins before flight leaves} # {the check-in crew} initiate {the check-in process} ;
    7. It seems that closing MUST happen after the check in desk is opened, thus rewriting into airline3.txt
